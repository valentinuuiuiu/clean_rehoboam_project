# 🔒 SECURE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## ⚠️ SECURITY FIRST

Your private keys are now protected. **NEVER commit private keys to git.**

## 🚀 How to Deploy Securely:

### 1. Set Your Private Key (Terminal Only):
```bash
export DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"
```

### 2. Verify It's Set:
```bash
echo "Private key set: ${DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY:0:10}..."
```

### 3. Deploy:
```bash
./DEPLOY_WITH_YOUR_ETH.sh
```

## 🛡️ Security Features Added:

- ✅ Private keys removed from all files
- ✅ Environment variable protection  
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore rules
- ✅ No sensitive data in git history
- ✅ Safe to push to public GitHub

## 📁 What's Protected:

The .gitignore now blocks:
- All private keys
- Wallet files  
- Secret configurations
- Deployment artifacts with addresses
- Foundry cache and broadcast data

## 🔄 To Use Your System:

1. Clone the repo
2. Set your private key: `export DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."`
3. Fund your wallet with 0.02 ETH
4. Run deployment script
5. Start earning (small) profits
